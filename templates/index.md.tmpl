# cloudvision Provider

The cloudvision provider allows a user to interact with cloudvision resources.

The provider gives the ability to
- Add new Arista EOS devices to Cloud vision portal.
- Manage Cloud vision portal configlets.
- Manage Cloud vision portal containers.
- Move Arista EOS devices to their proper containers.
- Attach additional configlets to each device.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    cvprovider = {
      source = "aristanetworks/cloudvision"
    }
  }
}

provider "cvprovider" {
    cvp = "www.cv-staging.corp.arista.io"
    token = "${var.cvptoken}"
    port = 443
}
```

### Required

This will need to be a version 2021.3.1 or higher of cloudvision or cvaas.

To receive a service token please follow [this guide](https://www.arista.com/en/cg-cv/cv-service-accounts)

Once the token is issued it will need to be either referenced within a var as the following.

```terraform
provider "cvprovider" {
    cvp = "10.90.226.175"
    cvptoken = "locationoftoken.txt"
    port = 443
}

```

The alternative and suggested method is to use a environmental variable.  For example,

```
export TF_VAR_cvptoken=123456789abcdefghi
```
